# Interpolation tables

# File names
The file names of the tables indicate the secondary particle species and the interaction type. Note that more than one particle species may be stored in each file (e.g. protons and antiprotons are stored in the same file).

# Table structure
The first column is the primary energy in GeV, and the first row is the secondary kinetic energy in GeV. The value at a given row and column is the production cross section $E^2d\sigma/dE$ (in mb GeV). A value of 0 in the column indicate the start of a new particle.
